# webcrawler
This Colab Web Crawler provides a user-friendly interface with buttons and text fields for mounting Google Drive, specifying a folder, and entering a URL to crawl. It recursively extracts text from all pages on the same domain, saving each pageâ€™s content (title, URL, timestamp, and text) as .txt files in your Drive.
